### <span style="color: green"> Bio. </span> 
**Ya Meng** Candidate Master in Wuhan University of China.

## <span style="color: green"> Research Interests </span>
My research interest is in **polar codes**. Specifically, my research is to find the error propagation pattern of the SC
decoding of polar codes, and to use this error pattern to improve the performance of the SC decoding.

    - Investigate the wireless network topology inference.
    - Infer the wireless network topology via the Graph Signal Processing (GSP) technology.     
  2. <p align="right">Feb. 2018 – Present</p>
    - Explore the negative effect of the unusual log-likelihood ratio (LLR) distribution from SC decoder
of inner polar codes on the outer LDPC code in a serial concatenation system.
    - Propose a log processing method to regulate the LLR values from the SC decoder and improve
the overall performance of the serial concatenation system.
    - Present the proof of the error correlation pattern (referred in the research experience in Anhui
University) and rearrange the implementation of the error correlation pattern in the interleaver
to improve the performance of a concatenation system with inner polar codes.
