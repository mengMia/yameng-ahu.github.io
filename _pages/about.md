### <span style="color: green"> Bio. </span> 
**Ya Meng** Candidate Master in Wuhan University of China.

## <span style="color: green"> Research Interests </span>
My research interest is in **polar codes**. Specifically, my research is to find the error propagation pattern of the SC
decoding of polar codes, and to use this error pattern to improve the performance of the SC decoding.
